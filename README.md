# BHoMAnalytics_Toolkit

The BHoMAnalytics_Toolkit provides a way to collect information regarding the usage of BHoM and save it in a central database.
Note that the BHoM_Ui is already collecting usage information but only stores it locally as log files. This toolkit's role is to send the content of those files to the database.


### Documentation
For more information about functionality see [the BHoMAnalytics wiki](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoMAnalytics_Toolkit/wiki)

---
This toolkit is part of the Buildings and Habitats object Model. Find out more on our [wiki](https://github.com/BHoM/documentation/wiki) or at [https://bhom.xyz](https://bhom.xyz/)

## Quick Start ðŸš€ 

Grab the [latest installer](https://bhom.xyz/) and a selection of [sample scripts](https://github.com/BHoM/samples).

As this toolkit is not part of the installer, you will need to compile it separately.


## Getting Started for Developers ðŸ¤– 

If you want to build the BHoM and the Toolkits from source, it's hopefully easy! ðŸ˜„
